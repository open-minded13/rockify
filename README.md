# Rockify — A Machine Learning Practice for Rock Music Sub-Genre Classification | Python Data Analysis & Visualization

Rockify is a machine-learning project aiming to classify rock music tracks into different subgenres, such as classic rock, punk rock, and metal rock. This project aims to explore the potential of machine learning in music genre classification and create a useful tool for music producers, streaming platforms, and music enthusiasts. The project uses various machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, decision tree, KNN, SVM, and logistic regression, to train and evaluate a model on a dataset of rock music tracks obtained from Spotify API. The project also provides a convenient query program that allows users to enter a song URL from Spotify and get the subgenre analysis result.

## Project Timeline

- **Start Date**: Jan 03, 2023
- **Completion Date**: Mar 17, 2023 ⛳️

## Demo Photos

- We use a heatmap to see the relationship between different categories:

## Installation

1. To install and run this project, you will need Python 3.7 or higher and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, spotipy, seaborn, matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip or conda. For example:

   `pip install pandas numpy sklearn spotipy seaborn matplotlib`

   or if you have installed Anaconda (which is one of the world's most popular data science platforms): 

   `conda install pandas numpy sklearn spotipy seaborn matplotlib`

2. You will also need to register a Spotify developer account and obtain a client ID and client secret. You can follow the instructions here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/

3. Then, you need to set the environment variables SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET with your credentials. For example:

   `export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-client-id'`
   
   `export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-client-secret'`

4. Finally, you can clone this repository or download the source code as a zip file.

   `git clone https://github.com/open-minded13/2023_Rockify`
   
## Results

The main result of this project is the random forest classifier model that achieved an accuracy of 0.6310 on the test dataset. This model outperformed other models such as decision tree, KNN, SVM, and logistic regression. The model was trained on 11 audio features (Danceability, Energy, Key, Loudness, Mode, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, and Tempo) obtained through the Spotify API, as well as a manual classification tag (sub-genre generated from playlists).

The following table shows the accuracy scores of different models on the test dataset:

- Random Forest	0.6310
- Decision Tree	0.4599
- KNN	0.3209
- SVM	0.2834
- Logistic Regression	0.4332

## Discussion

The discussion section of this project (in the full report) provides an in-depth analysis of the results and the implications of this project for music technology. It also discusses some of the challenges faced, limitations encountered, and future directions for improvement.

Some of the main points discussed are:

- Why random forest is the best model for Rockify.
- How random forest handles non-linear relationships and reduces overfitting.
- How different models compare with each other in terms of performance and complexity.
